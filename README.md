# Face Recognition with AdaBoost

From scratch implemtation of the AdaBoost algorithm using Haar-like features to detect face-images as part of one of my courses at LiU. 


All information about the algorithm, the implementation, the used data and some analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md).
